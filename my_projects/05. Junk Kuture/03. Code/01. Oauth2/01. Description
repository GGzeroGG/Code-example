Objective: Implement a secure authorization system within the project
Solution: We chose the oauth2 system where the authentication service was our
    server and it gave out pairs of tokens to the front and updated them
* - library was used "django-oauth-toolkit"
* - In the device model we kept the auth_token, so we could logout any device,
    the device was created when the application was started
