My first project when I got my job I learned a lot of new techniques and approaches
This project is a social network for pregnant girls where they can get
    information about pregnancy share posts comment and read other people's posts
This mobile app I was in charge of the back

In this project I:
    Understood what: api, http (methods, status code), rest
    Got the concept of celery
    Got push notifications with firebase
    Got familiar with ui and mock tests
    Got the concept of jwt
