This is my very first project written by me and a friend as a
    graduation project.
I didn't know how to do it, and I was learning django while doing this project,
    so the code is bad + we didn't know how to use the git so there are no
    branches and no pr and revue
The point of the project to make a computer parts online store and copy
    The functional known online stores without any novelty.
* - we didn't do a real payment instead put a stub

In this project I: understood what a data model is, learned the structure
    of django projects, understood what a view is, understood how routing
    works, what a template is and how to apply them, implemented an admin
    panel, touched the django application auth
